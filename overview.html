        <h2>Tools and Process</h2>
        <p>The app is created with XCode :</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">XCode</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The process of creating the app consists of:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Watching XCode tutorials on Youtube</li>
          <li>Learning Swift Language</li>
          <li>Coding all the thngs on the app</li>
          <li>Exporting it to a Phone</li>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Here's the code for a simple Tip Calculator app that allows the user to enter a bill amount and a tip percentage, and then calculates the tip amount and the total bill amount:</p>

<pre>
  <code>
    import UIKit

    class ViewController: UIViewController {

        @IBOutlet weak var billAmountTxt: UITextField!
        @IBOutlet weak var tipPercentTxt: UITextField!
        @IBOutlet weak var calculateTipBtn: UIButton!

        @IBOutlet weak var tipAmountLbl: UILabel!
        @IBOutlet weak var billTotalLbl: UILabel!

        @IBAction func calculateTip(_ sender: Any) {
            
            // Convert bill amount text to a Double
            let billAmount:Double = Double(billAmountTxt.text!)!
            
            // Calculate tip amount based on bill amount and tip percentage
            let tipAmount:Double = (Double(tipPercentTxt.text!)! / 100) * billAmount
            tipAmountLbl.text = String(format: "$%.02f", tipAmount)
            
            // Calculate total bill amount and update label
            billTotalLbl.text = String(format: "$%.02f", billAmount + tipAmount)
            
        }
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            
        }

    }
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Here's an explanation of what each part of the code does:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>import UIKit</code>: This line imports the UIKit framework, which contains classes for building iOS applications.</li>

  
  <li><code>class ViewController: UIViewController</code>: This declares a new class called <code>ViewController</code>, which inherits from <code>UIViewController</code>, one of the built-in view controller classes in UIKit. This means that <code>ViewController</code> is responsible for managing the user interface of the app.</li>

  
  <li><code>@IBOutlet weak var</code>: These lines declare six different user interface elements as outlets, which means that they can be accessed and modified programmatically. The <code>billAmountTxt</code> and <code>tipPercentTxt</code> are two text fields that allow the user to input the bill amount and the tip percentage, respectively. <code>calculateTipBtn</code> is a button that the user taps to calculate the tip. <code>tipAmountLbl</code> and <code>billTotalLbl</code> are two labels that display the tip amount and the total bill amount, respectively.</li>
  

  <li><code>@IBAction func calculateTip(_ sender: Any)</code>: This line declares an action method called <code>calculateTip</code>, which is triggered when the user taps the <code>calculateTipBtn</code> button.</li>
  

  <li><code>let billAmount:Double = Double(billAmountTxt.text!)!</code>: This line converts the bill amount entered by the user from a string to a double, and assigns it to a constant called <code>billAmount</code>.</li>
  

  <li><code>let tipAmount:Double = (Double(tipPercentTxt.text!)! / 100) * billAmount</code>: This line calculates the tip amount based on the bill amount and the tip percentage entered by the user. The tip percentage is divided by 100 to convert it from a percentage to a decimal, and then multiplied by the bill amount to get the tip amount. The result is assigned to a constant called <code>tipAmount</code>.</li>
  

  <li><code>tipAmountLbl.text = String(format: "$%.02f", tipAmount)</code>: This line formats the <code>tipAmount</code> as a currency string with two decimal places using the <code>String(format:)</code> method, and assigns it to the <code>text</code> property of the <code>tipAmountLbl</code> label.</li>
  

  <li><code>billTotalLbl.text = String(format: "$%.02f", billAmount + tipAmount)</code>: This line calculates the total bill amount by adding the bill amount and the tip amount, formats it as a currency string with two decimal places using the <code>String(format:)</code> method, and assigns it to the <code>text</code> property of the <code>billTotalLbl</code> label.</li>
  

  <li><code>override func viewDidLoad()</code>: This method is called when the view controller is loaded into memory. In this case, it doesn't do anything, so it's empty.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Connection to Previous Learning</h2>
        <p>The project builds upon previously learned computer science concepts such as programming logic, data types, and control structures. Additionally, the project incorporates design principles such as user experience and visual design.</p>
        <p>The project also has connections to other subjects such as science, specifically in the areas of physics and biology. For example, the game could incorporate scientific concepts such as genetics or physics principles to enhance the storyline and gameplay.</p>

        <h2>Terminology, Tools, and Processes</h2>
        <p>The project utilizes several programming and design concepts and tools, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Swift programming language</li>
          <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as XCode</li>
          <li>User Interface (UI) design principles</li>
          <li>Version control tools, such as Git and GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Throughout the project, we also learned new terminology and processes specific to app development, such as auto layout and Model-View-Controller (MVC).</p>

        <h2>Outcomes Compared to Goals</h2>
        <p>The outcomes of the project met the goals originally set, which were to create a app using XCode, and learn to export the app so it could be played on a phone. Additionally, the project allowed us to apply previously learned computer science concepts to a new context, and to develop our skills in programming and design.</p>

        <h2>Career Paths and Reflection</h2>
        <p>The skills learned through this project can lead to a variety of career paths, including game development, software engineering, and web development. While I may not pursue a career specifically in app development, the project allowed me to develop valuable skills in programming and design that can be applied to a variety of fields.</p>
