      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Tools and Process</h2>
        <p>The app is created with XCode :</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">XCode</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The process of creating the app consists of:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Watching XCode tutorials on Youtube</li>
          <li>Learning Swift Language</li>
          <li>Coding all the thngs on the app</li>
          <li>Exporting it to a Phone</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <p>Through this project, we learned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How to use XCode to create a IOS app</li>
          <li>How to use the Programming language : Swift</li>
          <li>How to design a app's interface </li>
          <li>How to apply previously learned computer science concepts to app development</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The visual novel game is created by coding different scenes using Python and Pygame. The scenes are then added together to create a cohesive storyline. The game is controlled by the player's choices, which determine the outcome of the story.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What I Created</h2>
        <p>I followed a tutorial for a tick tac toe app, but I modified it with sound effects that there is a "Ding" when a player wins and a "Buzz" when a invalid move is made.</p>

        <h2>Connection to Previous Learning</h2>
        <p>The project builds upon previously learned computer science concepts such as programming logic, data types, and control structures. Additionally, the project incorporates design principles such as user experience and visual design.</p>
        <p>The project also has connections to other subjects such as science, specifically in the areas of physics and biology. For example, the game could incorporate scientific concepts such as genetics or physics principles to enhance the storyline and gameplay.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Terminology, Tools, and Processes</h2>
        <p>The project utilizes several programming and design concepts and tools, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Swift programming language</li>
          <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as PyCharm</li>
          <li>User Interface (UI) design principles</li>
          <li>Version control tools, such as Git and GitHub</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Throughout the project, we also learned new terminology and processes specific to app development, such as auto layout and Model-View-Controller (MVC).</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Outcomes Compared to Goals</h2>
        <p>The outcomes of the project met the goals originally set, which were to create a app using XCode, and learn to export the app so it could be played on a phone. Additionally, the project allowed us to apply previously learned computer science concepts to a new context, and to develop our skills in programming and design.</p>

        <h2>Recommendations for Improvement</h2>
        <p>Some ways the project and/or performance could have been improved include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Planning and organization: Having a more detailed plan and timeline for the project could have helped with managing time and resources more effectively.</li>
          <li>Testing: Conducting more extensive testing of the game to futher add new modes and features</li>
          <li>Feedback : Asking peers to test the app and take in the feedback of what could be improved on</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Career Paths and Reflection</h2>
        <p>The skills learned through this project can lead to a variety of career paths, including game development, software engineering, and web development. While we may not pursue a career specifically in app development, the project allowed us to develop valuable skills in programming, design, and collaboration that can be applied to a variety of fields.</p>
